It was an internship task of ecommerce pages for desktop version,
with 4 pages and in product page I have added to layout one is list layout and grid layout for product,
showmore button is also working and when you click anywhere in products it will take you on product details page,
in Product details page I have added a review section where you can add review real-time and two default reviews are given,
As this project is not connected with database So I have given some default things to load.
